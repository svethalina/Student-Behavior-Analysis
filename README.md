## Proposed Framework

The proposed framework aims to analyze students' demographic data, study-related details, and psychological characteristics to determine whether a student is on the right track, struggling, or failing. It combines data from different domains to extract comprehensive knowledge about students' performance.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The framework involves collecting data from school records, including student details. The data is then preprocessed through formatting, cleaning, and sampling steps to prepare it for analysis.

## Feature Extraction

Feature extraction is performed to reduce the number of attributes and transform them into linear combinations of the original attributes. This step helps in identifying the most relevant features for predicting student performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The preprocessed data is used to train machine learning classifiers, such as Random Forest, which are popular for text classification tasks. The trained models are evaluated using hold-out or cross-validation methods to avoid overfitting and estimate their performance on unseen data.

## Results and Conclusion

The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 79% in classifying student performance into three categories: high, average, and low. The authors conclude that machine learning techniques with supervised learning algorithms can effectively understand and analyze student performance based on the provided data.

## Future Work

We plan on improving the efficiency of student performance analysis by providing technical solutions, such as dynamic user interaction models and alert systems for low-performing students. And also propose exploring neural networks and incorporating non-academic attributes for better prediction.

The journal paper presents a comprehensive approach to student performance analysis by combining various data sources and leveraging machine learning techniques. It highlights the potential of data-driven methods in educational settings for identifying struggling students and providing targeted interventions.
